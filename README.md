# undergrad-diabetes-prediction-xai
This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms—including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacking ensemble models—for early prediction of diabetes. Using two real-world datasets (PIMA and ESD), the study evaluates model performance through metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, model interpretability is addressed using SHAP and LIME, providing global and local insights into decision-making processes. The goal is to improve diagnostic transparency and support clinical application of predictive models.
