Undergraduate Final Project - Interpretable Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Physiological and Symptomatic Datasets

This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms—including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacking ensemble models—for early prediction of diabetes. Using two real-world datasets (PIMA and ESD), the study evaluates model performance through metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, model interpretability is addressed using SHAP and LIME, providing global and local insights into decision-making processes. The goal is to improve diagnostic transparency and support clinical application of predictive models.
